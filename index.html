	Retaining walls are constructed for properties where the soil may be weak or sub-par underneath. Retaining walls create a barrier to prevent erosion and can help keep your home safe, especially if you live on the side of the hill. Falling rocks and dirt can cause damage to your property. It can also make it more difficult to use your yard or garden.

	Retaining walls are also great for creating flat, level areas of land where other objects can be placed. If youâ€™re tired of looking at a cluttered yard without enough space to spread out, a retaining wall could be the perfect solution for your property.
